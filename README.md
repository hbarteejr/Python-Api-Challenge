# Python-Api-Challenge
This is where my Python-Api-Challenge will be located. 
In Part One, based upon the data, three observable trends based upon this data are as follows: weather plays a role in vacation location, time of the year plays a role, and there is a possible relationship between location and where one goes. Pulling the data in the charts will provide additional details on the scatter plot. Great learning experience on the use of API keys.
